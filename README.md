# Intro to Optimization Assignments

Assignments and experiments of Intro to Optimization course. The mathematical problem sets assignments and the paper report of this course will NOT be included in this  repo.

## What included

### Exp No.1: Application of one-dimensional search algorithm

Understand and master the golden section method and Newton's method in one-dimensional search algorithm, and use them to solve practical problems.

### Exp No.2: Dynamic Programming Problem Set

1.  Stair climbing problem. Enter your own n stairs, which can be climbed 1 or 2 steps at a time, and program to determine how many different ways you can climb the stairs.
2. Determine the best time to buy or sell a stock. Give yourself an array whose ith element is the price of a given stock on the ith day. Design an algorithm to calculate the maximum profit you can make. Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy it, and you cannot make multiple trades on the same day.
3. Backpacking problem. Five gold mines have been discovered in one country, each with different gold reserves and different numbers of workers involved in digging, as shown in the table below. The total number of workers involved in digging is 10, and each mine is either fully mined or not mined. Solve the program to find out which gold mines should be chosen to be dug in order to get as much gold as possible.
4. Treasure Hunt Problem.

### Exp No.3: Application of Genetic Algorithm - Traveling salesman problem

Please use genetic algorithm to solve the following traveler problem:
A traveler needs to travel to 10 cities in the country, and the coordinates of each city are shown in the cities.csv file. Design a reasonable route that minimizes the sum of the distances traveled by the traveler. 

**Note:** Each city can only be visited once and the traveler has to return to the original city he came out of at the end.
**Requirement:** Output the evolution curve of the fitness function and the map of the final chosen route.

### Exp No.4: Application of gradient descent method in artificial neural network

Please design and construct a neural network, and the gradient descent method is used to achieve the update of parameters and finally the recognition of 10 handwritten digits from 0-9. The data set is MNIST.
